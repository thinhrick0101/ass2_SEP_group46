## Workflow 3: Static analysis (`static_analysis_2.yml`)

pylint is a popular static code analysis tool for Python. It helps developers improve code quality by identifying programming errors, enforcing a coding standard, and offering simple refactoring suggestions. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of pylint:

Key Features
Static Code Analysis:

Error Detection: Identifies potential errors in the code, such as syntax errors, undefined variables, and type errors.
Code Quality: Highlights issues related to code quality, such as code smells and complex code that may be difficult to maintain.
Coding Standards Enforcement:

Ensures that the code adheres to PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8), which is the style guide for Python code.
Allows customization of coding standards to fit specific project or team requirements.
Refactoring Assistance:

Provides suggestions for improving code structure and making it more maintainable.
Helps identify redundant code and unused variables.
Extensible and Customizable:

Supports plugins and extensions, allowing developers to add custom checks or modify existing ones.
Configuration can be adjusted via .pylintrc configuration files.
Detailed Reports:

Generates comprehensive reports that include a summary of the issues found, categorized by severity.
Reports can be output in various formats, such as text, JSON, and HTML.
